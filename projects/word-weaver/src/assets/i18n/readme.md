# Translations

This is where all of your translations should go. JSON files containing translations for the WordWeaver web application are stored in `assets/i18n/*.json` and should be named after their language code as defined in `config/config.<language_code>.ts`. So, if you want your version of WordWeaver is translated into English (en) and French (fr) you will need `assets/i18n/en.json` and `assets/i18n/fr.json` files. If you want to add Spanish (es) you will need `assets/i18n/es.json` as well.

For translations related to your ~data~, you will need to update the files in `assets/i18n/data/*.json` similarly. Consider using a tool like [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) or [BabelEdit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit) to help manage your translations.
